# Add GitHub Issues to Omnifocus






## Developing

- [Add the Omnifocus application to your Script Editor
    library][omlib]
    by opening Script Editor, Window -> Library, the "+" button and then
    selecting OmniFocus.
    - Make sure to switch to JavaScript view.
- `osa2` is used to open functions with OSA. It provides a bridge to and from
    the function executed in the OSA environment.
